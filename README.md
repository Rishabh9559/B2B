## Project Summary: ProcureFlow – Intelligent Supplier Management Web App

ProcureFlow is designed to streamline procurement processes by automating supplier management and purchase operations. Our current development focus includes the following key features:

### 1. Supplier Registration Form

**What It Is:**

A user-friendly interface where suppliers can sign up by providing essential business information and uploading necessary documentation. The registration form includes real-time validations to ensure data accuracy.

**Key Components:**

* Input fields for company details (name, address, contact information).
* File upload functionality for certification and compliance documents.
* Data validation (both client-side and server-side) to minimize errors.

**Prerequisite Technology:**

* **Frontend:** React (or Angular/Vue) for a dynamic form interface with live validation feedback.
* **Backend:** Node.js (or Django) API for processing registration data.
* **Database:** PostgreSQL or MongoDB to securely store supplier profiles.
* **File Storage:** AWS S3 or Azure Blob Storage for managing uploaded documents.

### 2. Supplier Profile Verification

**What It Is:**

An administrative feature that allows procurement managers to review and verify supplier submissions. This process ensures that only legitimate suppliers gain access to the platform.

**Key Components:**

* A dashboard listing all new supplier registrations with pending verifications.
* Detailed view of supplier profiles, including uploaded documents.
* Action buttons for “Verify” or “Reject,” with rejection prompting a feedback message.
* Audit logging to maintain a record of verification actions.

**Prerequisite Technology:**

* **Frontend:** React components for displaying supplier lists and profile details.
* **Backend:** Secure API endpoints in Node.js (or Django) to handle verification status updates.
* **Database:** Relational or NoSQL database (PostgreSQL/MongoDB) for maintaining supplier records and verification statuses.
* **Authentication:** Role-based access control to restrict verification actions to authorized users.

### 3. Purchase Order Creation

**What It Is:**

A feature enabling procurement managers to create, manage, and track purchase orders electronically. This process replaces manual order creation with a streamlined digital workflow.

**Key Components:**

* Form for creating a new purchase order with fields for supplier selection, item details, quantities, and cost breakdown.
* Capability to save drafts, submit orders, and track order statuses.
* Automated notifications for order confirmation and subsequent status updates.

**Prerequisite Technology:**

* **Frontend:** React for interactive forms and order tracking interfaces.
* **Backend:** Node.js (or Django) API to process and manage order data.
* **Database:** PostgreSQL/MongoDB for persisting purchase order information.
* **Notifications:** Integration with email/SMS APIs or push notifications for real-time order updates.

### 4. Procurement Dashboard Analytics

**What It Is:**

An interactive dashboard that provides real-time insights into key procurement metrics such as spend analysis, supplier performance, and order history. This enables informed decision-making for procurement teams.

**Key Components:**

* Data visualization tools (charts, graphs, KPIs) for summarizing procurement activities.
* Filtering options to view data across different time periods, supplier categories, or order statuses.
* Export functionality for custom reports in formats like PDF or CSV.

**Prerequisite Technology:**

* **Frontend:** React along with data visualization libraries (e.g., Chart.js, D3.js) to render interactive analytics.
* **Backend:** Node.js (or Django) API for fetching aggregated data.
* **Database:** PostgreSQL/MongoDB to store historical procurement data.
* **Analytics Engine:** Optionally, integration with business intelligence tools or custom-built analytics modules for real-time data processing.

### 5. User Profile and Settings Management

**What It Is:**

A centralized hub where users can manage their personal information, adjust application settings, and customize their user experience. This feature ensures that user data remains secure and that preferences are easily accessible.

**Key Components:**

* Editable user profile details including name, email, contact information, and profile picture.
* Password management and security settings.
* Customization options for UI themes, notification preferences, and other personalized settings.
* Integration with role-based access control to display features based on user roles.

**Prerequisite Technology:**

* **Frontend:** React for building a responsive, interactive user profile interface.
* **Backend:** Node.js (or Django) for secure handling of user data and settings.
* **Database:** Secure storage for user profiles (PostgreSQL/MongoDB).
* **Authentication & Authorization:** Implementation of user authentication (JWT, OAuth) and role-based permissions.
